## Issues & Improvements ðŸ”§

### High Priority

#### 1. HUD Not Visible
**Issue**: HUD component not rendering
**Impact**: Missing tempo, zoom level, clip count, selection info
**Screenshot**: All screenshots show no HUD
**Recommendation**:
- Check if HUD is conditionally hidden
- Verify HUD CSS positioning (might be off-screen)
- Ensure HUD component is included in layout
- Add toggle for HUD visibility

#### 2. Command Palette Not Responding
**Issue**: Cmd+K keyboard shortcut not triggering command palette
**Impact**: Power users can't access commands quickly
**Test Result**: Command palette visible: false
**Recommendation**:
- Debug keyboard event listeners
- Check if event is being captured by another component
- Verify Redux state for command palette visibility
- Test both Meta+K (Mac) and Ctrl+K (Windows/Linux)

#### 3. Pattern Selection Visual Feedback
**Issue**: Need to verify selection highlighting works
**Impact**: User may not know which pattern is selected
**Recommendation**:
- Click test shows no visible selection indicator
- Add clear visual feedback (border glow, color change)
- Ensure selected state persists in Redux
- Test multi-selection visual feedback

### Medium Priority

#### 4. Pattern Visual Consistency
**Observation**: Some patterns have diagonal stripes, others are solid
**Question**: Is this intentional (muted vs unmuted, or pattern types)?
**Recommendation**:
- Document pattern visual language
- If stripes = muted, add legend or tooltip
- Ensure pattern states are visually distinct
- Consider accessibility (color + pattern for states)

#### 5. Track Header Interaction
**Issue**: Clicking track header shows "Current tracks: 0"
**Impact**: Track selection/focus may not be working
**Recommendation**:
- Verify track selection Redux state
- Add visual feedback for current/selected track
- Test track header click handlers
- Add keyboard navigation for track selection

#### 6. Pattern Editor Not Opening
**Issue**: Double-clicking pattern doesn't open editor
**Impact**: Can't edit pattern data
**Test Result**: Pattern editor opened: false
**Recommendation**:
- Debug double-click event handler
- Verify pattern editor Redux state
- Check if editor component is included
- Add visual indication that pattern is editable (cursor change)

#### 7. Minimap Missing
**Observation**: No minimap visible in screenshots
**Impact**: Hard to navigate large projects
**Recommendation**:
- Check if minimap is toggled off by default
- Verify minimap component rendering
- Add toggle button for minimap
- Consider making minimap collapsible

### Low Priority (Polish & UX)

#### 8. Track Heights
**Observation**: All tracks appear to be same height
**Recommendation**:
- Implement variable track heights (user-adjustable)
- Add resize handles between tracks
- Save track heights in project data
- Add vertical zoom for track density

#### 9. Horizontal Scrollbar
**Observation**: No visible horizontal scrollbar
**Recommendation**:
- Add styled scrollbar at bottom
- Show timeline extent indicator
- Add scroll position indicator on minimap
- Implement smooth scrolling

#### 10. Pattern Labels Overlap at High Zoom
**Potential Issue**: At current zoom, some pattern labels may overlap
**Recommendation**:
- Test label rendering at various zoom levels
- Implement label fade-in based on pattern width
- Add tooltip for truncated labels
- Consider smart label placement algorithm

#### 11. Scene Marker Interaction
**Question**: Can users edit scene markers?
**Recommendation**:
- Add click-to-edit scene names
- Allow scene duration editing
- Add scene color customization
- Implement scene duplication/deletion

#### 12. Grid Density
**Observation**: Grid appears dense at current zoom
**Recommendation**:
- Make grid density zoom-dependent
- Add grid snap options (bars, beats, subdivisions)
- Allow grid toggle
- Add grid color customization

#### 13. Status Line/Footer
**Observation**: Footer shows keyboard shortcuts (good!)
**Recommendation**:
- Add more contextual shortcuts based on selection
- Highlight available shortcuts based on context
- Add status messages area
- Show loading/saving indicators

#### 14. Track Color Coding
**Observation**: Track headers have small colored indicators
**Recommendation**:
- Make track colors more prominent
- Add color picker for track customization
- Use track colors in patterns (subtle tint)
- Add color-coding presets

### Accessibility & Responsive

#### 15. Keyboard Navigation
**Test**: Limited keyboard testing performed
**Recommendation**:
- Full keyboard navigation audit
- Add focus indicators for all interactive elements
- Document all keyboard shortcuts
- Test screen reader compatibility

#### 16. Mobile Responsiveness
**Note**: Desktop-first design evident
**Recommendation**:
- Test on tablet viewports
- Consider touch-friendly controls for tablets
- Add mobile warning/optimized view
- Implement responsive track heights

#### 17. High DPI/4K Displays
**Recommendation**:
- Test on retina/4K displays
- Ensure grid lines render crisply
- Check font rendering at high DPI
- Verify canvas elements scale properly

### Performance

#### 18. Large File Testing
**Current Test**: 7 tracks, 8 scenes (relatively small)
**Recommendation**:
- Test with 16 tracks (Cirklon maximum)
- Test with 100+ scenes
- Implement virtualization for large projects
- Add performance monitoring
- Lazy-load patterns outside viewport

#### 19. Animation Performance
**Observation**: Zoom transitions appear instant
**Recommendation**:
- Add smooth zoom animations (optional)
- Implement smooth scroll
- Optimize re-renders with React.memo
- Profile component render times

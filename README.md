# Song Arranger

Web-based timeline tool for sketching song structures with retro VT terminal aesthetic.

## Overview

Song Arranger lets you plan out song arrangements in a visual timeline interface similar to Ableton Live's arrange view, but without audio or MIDI processing. Perfect for planning your tracks while away from the studio.

## Features (Planned)

- **Timeline Interface:** Horizontal lanes for different parts (kick, bass, lead, etc.)
- **Drag & Drop:** Create, resize, and move clips on the timeline
- **Retro Aesthetic:** VT terminal inspired design with CRT effects
- **Duration Tracking:** Calculate song and section durations based on tempo
- **Zoom Controls:** Navigate your arrangement at different scales

## Tech Stack

- React 18+ with TypeScript
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- Vite for build tooling
- Jest + React Testing Library for testing

## Design Inspiration

Inspired by the [Monolake 8bit project](https://roberthenke.com/concerts/monolake8bit.html) with its authentic VT terminal aesthetic.
